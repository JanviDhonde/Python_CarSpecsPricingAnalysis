## 🚗 Car Dataset Analysis  

### 📜 Project Overview  
This project, completed as part of my internship at **Unified Mentor Pvt Ltd**, involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information about various car models. The analysis focused on data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends in the automobile industry.  

### 🎯 Project Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.  
- Engineer new features like car age and categorize engine horsepower (HP).  
- Perform EDA to identify key patterns and relationships.  
- Visualize findings for actionable insights.  

### 🔑 Key Insights  

#### 1. Pricing and Engine Performance  
- **Engine HP and MSRP**: A strong positive correlation between engine horsepower and price, with higher HP vehicles commanding premium pricing.  
- **MSRP by Engine Cylinders**: Vehicles with more cylinders tend to have higher average prices.  

#### 2. Mileage and Efficiency  
- **Highway MPG**: Certain manufacturers, like **Toyota** and **Honda**, lead in fuel efficiency.  
- **City MPG**: Similar trends observed, emphasizing efficiency in urban settings.  

#### 3. Popularity and Vehicle Styles  
- **Popular Makes**: **Chevrolet**, **Ford**, and **Toyota** dominate in the number of models.  
- **Vehicle Size Preferences**: Compact vehicles are the most popular, likely due to their affordability and fuel efficiency.  

#### 4. Transmission Types  
- Automatic transmissions are overwhelmingly dominant, with manual and automated manual being less common.  

#### ⚙️ Tools and Technologies Used  
- **🐍 Python**: Libraries used include pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.  

### 📊 Visualizations  

#### 1. Engine HP Distribution  
The majority of cars have engine horsepower in the low-to-mid range, making them accessible to the average buyer.  

#### 2. Engine HP vs MSRP  
A positive trend is observed between engine horsepower and vehicle pricing.  

#### 3. Vehicle Size Preferences  
Compact and midsize vehicles dominate, indicating their practicality for most users.  

#### 4. Correlation Heatmap  
Shows relationships between various features like engine HP, city MPG, and MSRP.  

### 💡 Why This Project Matters  
- **Consumer Insights**: Helps consumers understand pricing, performance, and efficiency trends.  
- **Industry Trends**: Assists manufacturers in identifying market preferences, such as popular vehicle sizes and transmission types.  
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Provides actionable insights for stakeholders in pricing, marketing, and development strategies.  

### 📚 Project Learnings  
- **Data Cleaning**: Efficiently handled missing values and outliers, ensuring accurate analysis.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Created meaningful new columns (e.g., car age, HP category) to enhance insights.  
- **EDA and Visualization**: Gained insights using scatter plots, count plots, histograms, and heatmaps.  
- **Outlier Detection**: Utilized the IQR method to handle extreme data points.
